# Lesson 2: June 17

## Goals
- Learn variable scope
- Learn functions/methods
- Learn how classes work and why (classes, instance variables)
- Learn about static methods and instance members
- Learn about the control system and how code runs on the robot
- Learn about classes we can use from wpilib

## Steps
- How did the homework go? Did you get stuck on something?
- Problem: Need to represent things that don't exist as built in types (Dog class)
- Define: Class, Instance
- Control system in 2 minutes
  Motors -> Motor controllers -> RoboRIO
- WPILib: How we use classes in FRC (Define: instantiate, method/function, parameters)
- Using TalonSRX class and comparison to built in classes/types
- Creating a class: Dog class 
- Define: Constructor, Scope, Parameters, Block Scope, Method Scope, Class Members, `this.`
- Define: Access Modifiers: Public/Private/Protected
- Return statements and return types
- Example: Inheritance (Cat, Dog, Fish classes)
- Static Methods/members TODO: do this next time

## Assignment: Make 3 connected classes
- Use https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php
- This is kind of open ended, you can use one of the example ideas or come up with your own.
- Make at least 3 classes
- All of the classes should have at least one method defined in it.
- At least one of the classes should extend from another class.
- In addition you should have a Main class with a main method (like in [Animal.java](./Animal.java)) that demonstrates your classes being used.
- Examples:
  - Bike, Car, Vehicle
  - Penguin, Chicken, Bird, Animal
  - Paper, Metal, Material
  - Student, Employee, Person
