# Lesson 1: June 10 - How to tell the computer what you want it to do

## Learning objectives:
- Learn base programming concepts (variables, if/else, while/for loops)
- Learn steps to make the computer run your code
- Learn and practice what to do when you get stuck

## Steps
- No FRC today
- What is coding, who has experience coding
- No copy pasting
- I demonstrate how to write a hello world program (println)
- Comments
- Variables, Ints, Booleans, Strings, Assignment, Reassignment, Referencing variables
- If/Else, Checking equals, comparison operators
- Together we write Is It Prime program (while loops)
- Steps for solving a problem with code:
  - Understand the problem
  - Solve the problem manually, on paper or in your head. Record the steps you do
  - Figure out which steps are being repeated and how to represent the steps in code
- Homework project: Fibonacci project

## Assignment: Fibonacci number generator
- The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first two numbers are 1 and 1.
  Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.
- Make a program that computes and outputs each of the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- Go to https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php to write your code in there. When you are done, copy and paste the code somewhere else so that you don't lose access to it.
- By the end of Saturday, I want to hear from each person on slack how far you got on the project or if you finished. It's ok if you haven't finished it.
- If you get stuck before or after then, feel free to post what you are stuck on in slack on #programming, and I will help you get back on track.
- Don't stress about this. If you get frustrated, take a break and post on slack what you are stuck on.
- Don't look up how to code a fibonacci number generator. You are trying to learn how to solve problems, and seeing how someone else solves it won't help you practice solving it.
- Next week, each person will tell us one thing you got stuck on but figured out.
