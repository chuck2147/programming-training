# Lesson 11: August 25: Custom Triggers for commands

## Steps
- Review: Running commands on button presses
- What about binding to physical buttons on the robot?
  - Example: "Reset elevator" button via limit switch
- What about running commands based on joystick/trigger movement?
  - Example: Binding to the trigger buttons on an xbox controller
- Requiring multiple buttons to be pressed at the same time
  - Example: Making some potentially-destructive action really difficult to do by accident - "Reset gyro" button combination
