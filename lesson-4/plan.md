## Assignment: Identify/Guess motion control used in real frc robots

- Find an frc robot and identify 3 different degrees of freedom (moving parts or axes)

Suggestions (you don't have to use one of these, you can find your own if you want):

- 2056 in 2016
- 971 in 2019
- 118 in 2018
- 2471 in 2018
- 2733 in 2019
- 610 in 2019
- 2471 in 2019
- 2046 in 2019
- 2046 in 2018

More complicated motion control:
- 254 in 2019

- Look on https://www.thebluealliance.com/ for robot videos, search for the team, select the year dropdown, watch their reveal video if they have one, or a match video.
- For each degree of freedom, try to figure out which kind of motion control they are using, or think about which kinds of motion control you might use if you were programming that robot. Exclude degrees of freedom where you think they are only using manual control.
- Post the robot videos and motion controls you identified on #programming
- Watch each other's videos and discuss (if you want)
